How to use:

To use 1 uppercase letter, click SHIFT and then the letter.
Double-clicking SHIFT will activate caps lock. Clicking SHIFT once again will deactivate it.
To use special keys, numbers and symbols, click SWITCH.
To use symbols in smaller letters on the keyboard, click SHIFT and then the key.
Double-clicking SHIFT will act like holding down the SHIFT key so you can continuously type those symbols.
When you click SHIFT once again, it will be released.
Use BACKSPACE, ENTER and SPACE as expected.
